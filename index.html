      <p>I was born in Burnsville, Minnesota, but raised in the rainy city of Seattle, WA</p>

      <p>One of my favorite things to eat in Seattle is sushi but for some reason I have never gotten the hang of the taste of wasabi</p>

      <p>I have a son who is 8 months old, and it's great to see him grow every day!</p>

      <p>My favorite season is Autum! I love all the colors of the leaves and wearing sweaters and pumplin spice lattes!</p>
